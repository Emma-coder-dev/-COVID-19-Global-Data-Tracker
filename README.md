# üìå COVID-19 Global Data Trackerü¶†

## üìù Project Description:
This project provides an analysis and visualization of COVID-19 trends globally. It tracks the spread of cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations over time, across various countries. The notebook includes various data processing, analysis, and visualization techniques to help understand the ongoing pandemic's patterns.

## üö©Objectives of the Project:
- Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- Analyze time trends for cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations
- Compare metrics across different countries and regions
- Visualize trends with charts and maps
- Provide insights and summaries based on the data

## üõ†Tools and Libraries Used:
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization
- **plotly**: Interactive plotting (optional choropleth map)
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment

## How to Run/View the Project:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the notebook file (`COVID_19_Global_Tracker.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension.
3. Ensure all required libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
4. Run the notebook from start to finish to see the analysis and visualizations.

## Insights and Reflections:
 This analysis revealed interesting trends in the global distribution of COVID-19 cases and vaccination progress.

For instance, [
### Key Insights:
1. **COVID-19 Cases Over Time**: The USA has the highest cumulative COVID-19 cases, followed by India and Kenya. We observe significant spikes during certain periods (e.g., 2020).
2. **Vaccination Rollouts**: The USA and India show substantial vaccination progress, with India having a rapid increase in vaccinations since late 2021.
3. **Death Rates**: The death rate for the USA appears to be slightly higher than that of India, which could be attributed to various factors like healthcare infrastructure.].
